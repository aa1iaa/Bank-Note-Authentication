# Bank-Note-Authentication
The project aims to apply unsupervised machine learning to the banknote authentication dataset by using the K-Means clustering algorithm. It seeks to identify natural groupings within the data and evaluate whether banknotes can be effectively clustered based on extracted features, helping distinguish genuine notes from forged notes.
